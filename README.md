## Eco-Track

Eco-Track is a web-based sustainability tracking platform built during a hackathon to help individuals monitor, understand, and reduce their environmental impact. The goal is to make sustainability measurable, actionable, and engaging through data visualization and user-friendly design.

Many people want to reduce their carbon footprint but lack clear, accessible tools to track their daily environmental impact. Existing solutions are often complex, static, or disconnected from real user behavior.

Eco-Track provides a centralized dashboard where users can:

Log daily activities (transportation, energy use, food consumption)

Track estimated carbon emissions

Visualize trends over time

The platform turns everyday inputs into structured data that users can analyze and act on.
